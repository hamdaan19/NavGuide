# NavGuide
## About

NavGuide is a device that primarily aims to assist visually challenged people while navigating through new and dynamic environments. Our project focuses on road-crossing scenarios since visually challenged individuals find it the most difficult to cope with. Unlike existing solutions in the literature which use resource-demanding SLAM-based techniques, our algorithm is computationally efficient and fast. NavGuide works based on a framework which depends on a stereo camera for perception of the surroundings. The device contains haptic actuators to give the required feedback to the user.
